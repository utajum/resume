Since 2023, I've been experimenting with running local and cloud LLMs and integrating them into various applications, particularly in areas where traditional code struggles and human-like interaction is needed.<br>\n<br>\nI often can't help but dive in and contribute, whether it's fixing a bug or entering a simple bug report. Some of my proudest moments include getting my code merged into GitLab and Visual Studio Code.
